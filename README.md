# Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in a College Campus using Edge AI

## Mentors 
- Institute Mentor: Dr. Vidya S.Rao, Associate Professor, Dept of Instrumentation & Control Enginnering, MIT, MAHE, Manipal
- Industry Mentor: Kalyana Devulapally

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a smart system using Edge AI. This system will analyze how vehicles move into and out of a college campus by using images
from cameras that capture vehicle photos and license plates. The system aims to give us valuable information about:
- Vehicle Movement Analysis
- Parking Occupancy
- Vehicle Matching

## Requirements
